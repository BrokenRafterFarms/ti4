# TI4 Generator
A web tool to generate Twilight Imperium 4 game boards through many custom settings.

The generation link: [8 Player 3D Only](https://brokenrafterfarms.github.io/ti4/)

## Details:

This fork is based on a generation script built by [KeeganW](https://github.com/KeeganW/ti4)

It has been customized to allow for a 3d board like the one below:

Building on top of what Keegan has already done the following image shows how the tiles are layed out and how I changed the layout.

The adjacencyData.json was updated to make sure the tiles where correctly related to each other for calculation purposes.
* Top Layer: Tile 19 in the middle
* Middle Layer: Tile 0 in the middle
* Lower Layer: Tile 38 in the middle
* Wormhole Planets (leftover pieces)

To achieve this the 8 player setup in boardData.json has been updated with new home world locations and primary and secondary planets.
Helpers.js was also updated to the html put the planets in the correct spot for the 3d map.


I did not spend to much time trying to balance everything cause we just used this a starting point then customized it from there.


Side note: Also created a github action to auto publish the build when pushed to main.
